--- 2: Performing Calculations with Variables ---

Now that you’ve set up a savings variable, let’s take it a step further and use it to explore some calculations.

Imagine you’re planning to save $10 every month. How much money will you have saved in four months? Rather than working with the numbers directly, let’s use variables to perform the calculation.

Instructions
1. Create a variable called monthly_savings and assign it the value 10.
2. Define another variable, num_months, and set its value to 4.
3. Multiply monthly_savings by num_months and store the result in a variable called new_savings.
4. Finally, display the value of new_savings using the print() function.

"""

monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 4
new_savings = monthly_savings * num_months
print(new_savings)

--- 1: Working with Variables in Python ---

Variables in Python serve as a way to label and store values for later use. For example, to define a variable named x and assign it the value 10, you can use the = symbol like this:

x = 10

Once assigned, you can reference x instead of repeatedly typing the value 5 in your code.
Important Note: In Python, the = symbol is used for assignment, not for checking equality. To test this out, follow the instructions below by replacing the placeholders with your own code.

Instructions
1. Assign the value 100 to a variable called savings.
2. Verify your variable by adding the line print(savings) to the script and running it.
"""

savings = 100
print(savings)

savings = 100
print(savings)

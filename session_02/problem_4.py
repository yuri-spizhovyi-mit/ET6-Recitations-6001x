(While Loop Version): Multiplication Table for Numbers 1-9
Explanation:
We use two while loops:
The outer loop iterates through numbers 1 to 9 (for which we generate tables).
The inner loop iterates from 1 to 10 to print the multiplication table for each number.
The output is formatted to display each table clearly.
Instructions:
1. Initialize a variable (num) for the multiplication table starting from 1.
2. Use a while loop to iterate num from 1 to 9.
3. Inside this loop, use another while loop for numbers 1 to 10.
4. Print each multiplication result, then increment counters properly.
5. If you have time implemnt it with for loop as well/

# Initialize outer loop counter

# Outer loop: Iterate through numbers 1 to 9

# Initialize inner loop counter

# Inner loop: Iterate from 1 to 10

    # Increment inner loop counter

# Increment outer loop counter

Problem 2: Checking for a Palindrome
Explanation:
A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., "madam", "racecar"). We can check for palindromes using string slicing and conditionals.

Instructions:
1. Ask the user to enter a word.
2. Convert the word to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.
3. Check if the word is the same when reversed.
4. Print "It's a palindrome!" if true, otherwise print "Not a palindrome."

## Get user input


# Convert to lowercase for case insensitivity by cally lower() function 

# Check if the word is the same forward and backward

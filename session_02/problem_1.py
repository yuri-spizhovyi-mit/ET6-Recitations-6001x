Problem 1: String Manipulation & Slicing
Explanation:
Strings in Python are sequences of characters and can be manipulated using indexing and slicing.

Indexing: Access a specific character using its position (e.g., s[0] gives the first character).
Slicing: Extract a portion of the string using s[start:end], where start is inclusive and end is exclusive.
Negative Indexing: Allows access from the end of the string (s[-1] is the last character).
Instructions:
1. Create a variable message with the value "Recitation Session".
2. Print the first and last characters using indexing.
3. Extract and print the substring "Recitation" using slicing.
4. Extract and print the substring "Session" using slicing.
5. Print the string in reverse order.

**Recitation Session 1**

Our primary objective during recitation hours is to tackle the challenging aspects of the MITx courses by working through additional coding scenarios. Detailed instructions for each coding exercise are provided in the exercises and are described as comments in the Python files within the designated GitHub repository. You can pull changes from the repository after the solution is published to access the material.

**Session Workflow:**

**Brief review/introduction**

**Breakout Room Activities:**
During the session, you will be assigned to random breakout rooms. In these rooms, you’ll collaborate with your teammates by sharing screens and following the provided instructions to implement Python code.

**Independent Collaboration:**
After the session ends, and before the next one, you’ll have the opportunity to work independently or collaborate on your personal repositories if you wish. Note that your repositories will not be reviewed as part of the course.

**Code Review and Main Room Discussions:**
In the last 30 minutes of each session, we will regroup in the main room for a walkthrough of the solution. The code will be reviewed, explained, and executed for everyone’s understanding.

**Anonymous Feedback Form**

Flattening a Nested List
Explanation:
Imagine you have a list containing elements that are not only integers and strings but also other lists. Your goal is to convert this nested list into a flat list where all elements appear in a single-level list without changing their order. This process is called flattening a list.

For example, a nested list like [[1, 'a', ['cat'], 2], [[[3]], 'dog'], 4, 5] should be flattened into [1, 'a', 'cat', 2, 3, 'dog', 4, 5].

The key challenge is that the nesting can be deep and unpredictable—you don’t know how many layers of lists there might be. Recursion is a powerful tool to handle this. Each time you encounter a sublist, you recursively flatten it until all elements are in a single-level list.

Instructions:
1. Define the function flatten(aList) that takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened version.
2. Initialize an empty list called newList to store the flattened elements.
3. Iterate through each element in the given list (aList):
  - If the element is not a list, append it directly to newList.
  - If the element is a list, recursively call flatten on that sublist and extend newList with the result.
4. Finally, return newList as the flattened list.

Example Run:

print(flatten([[1, 'a', ['cat'], 2], [[[3]], 'dog'], 4, 5]))
# Output: [1, 'a', 'cat', 2, 3, 'dog', 4, 5]

print(flatten([1, [2, [3, [4, 5]]]]))
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(flatten(['hello', ['world', ['!']]]))
# Output: ['hello', 'world', '!']
"""


def flatten(aList):
    """
    aList: a list
    Returns a copy of aList, which is a flattened version of aList
    """

    newList = []  # Initialize an empty list to store the flattened elements

    for item in aList:
        if (
            type(item) is not list
        ):  # If the item is not a list, add it directly to newList
            newList.append(item)
        else:
            newList += flatten(
                item
            )  # If the item is a list, recursively flatten it and extend newList with the result

    return newList  # Return the flattened list


print(flatten([[1, "a", ["cat"], 2], [[[3]], "dog"], 4, 5]))

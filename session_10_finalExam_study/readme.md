# **Final Exam Preparation Session**

## **Overview**

This session is designed to help you review key programming concepts and improve your problem-solving skills before the final exam. You will work on three coding problems, each focusing on important topics such as **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), list manipulation, dictionary operations, string processing, exception handling, and defensive programming**.

Each problem has a **specific time limit**, allowing you to practice coding efficiently under time constraints.

## **Session Breakdown**

### **Problem 1: MITCampus Tent Management (25 minutes)**

#### **Scenario**

You are designing a system for managing **tent locations** on an MIT campus. The campus has a **fixed center location**, and tents can be placed at different positions **if they meet certain conditions**.

#### **Task**

Implement the `MITCampus` class, which allows the following:

- **Adding tents** – A tent can be added **only if** it is **at least 0.5 units away** from all existing tents.
- **Removing tents** – A tent can be removed from the campus, and an error should be raised if the tent does not exist.
- **Retrieving tents** – A method should return a **sorted list of all tent locations** based on their x-coordinates.

#### **Concepts Covered**

✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
✅ List Manipulation (adding, sorting, and removing elements)  
✅ Defensive Programming (handling invalid cases)  

⏳ **Time Limit:** 25 minutes

### **Problem 2: Sum of Digits in a String (15 minutes)**

#### **Scenario**

You need to implement a function that extracts and sums **all digits in a given string**. If the string contains no digits, an error should be raised.

#### **Task**

- Implement `sum_digits(s)`, a function that scans a string, identifies numerical digits, and returns their sum.
- If no digits are found in the string, **raise a `ValueError` exception**.

#### **Concepts Covered**

✅ String Processing  
✅ Exception Handling (`try-except`)  
✅ Looping and Conditional Logic  

⏳ **Time Limit:** 15 minutes

### **Problem 3: Simple Cipher Mapping (10 minutes)**

#### **Scenario**

You are given two strings that define a **substitution cipher mapping**. You need to implement a function that **creates a dictionary mapping** and uses it to decode a given coded message.

#### **Task**

- Implement `cipher(map_from, map_to, code)`, a function that creates a **key-value mapping** from `map_from` to `map_to`.
- The function should return **a dictionary with character mappings** and **decode the given `code` using the dictionary**.

#### **Concepts Covered**

✅ Dictionary Operations (Key-Value Mapping)  
✅ String Manipulation  
✅ Encoding & Decoding Logic  

⏳ **Time Limit:** 10 minutes

Good luck, and happy coding!

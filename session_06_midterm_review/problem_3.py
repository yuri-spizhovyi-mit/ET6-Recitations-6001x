# Instructions:
# 1. Define a function `score(word, f)` that takes a string `word` and a function `f` as input.
# 2. The `word` is a string of length greater than 1, consisting of alphabetical characters (both uppercase and lowercase).
# 3. The function `f` is a function that takes in two integer arguments and returns an integer.
# 4. The scoring process involves:
#    a) Calculating the score for each letter in the word based on its position in the alphabet (a = 1, b = 2, ..., z = 26).
#       The score for each letter is calculated as:
#       - `letter_score = letter_position_in_alphabet * index_in_word`
#       For example, for the word "adD":
#       - 'a' has position 1, and is at index 0, so its score is `1 * 0 = 0`.
#       - 'd' has position 4, and is at index 1, so its score is `4 * 1 = 4`.
#       - 'D' has position 4 (same as 'd'), and is at index 2, so its score is `4 * 2 = 8`.

#    b) Find the two highest letter scores from the word. These scores will be the two highest values in the list of letter scores.

# 5. The final score of the word is calculated by applying the function `f` to the two highest letter scores.
# The first argument to `f` is the highest score, and the second argument is the second-highest score.

# Implementation Steps:
# - Initialize an empty list `letter_scores` to store the letter scores.
# - Iterate through each letter in the word. For each letter:
#   - Find its position in the alphabet by using a dictionary and multiply it by its index in the word.
#   - Append the result to `letter_scores`.
# - Sort `letter_scores` in descending order to get the highest scores at the front.
# - Apply the function `f` to the two highest scores and return the result.

# Example:
# For the word 'adD', the letter scores are [0, 4, 8]. The highest scores are 8 and 4.
# If `f` is the sum of its arguments, then the final score would be:
# f(8, 4) = 12
